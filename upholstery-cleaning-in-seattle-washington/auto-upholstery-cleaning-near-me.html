"@type": "Question",

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "In a city like Seattle where the climate is generally more humid than drier areas (e.g., parts of Colorado), it is recommended to have your upholstery cleaned every 12-24 months due to higher moisture levels that can encourage mold and mildew growth. However, households with pets, children, or high usage may need more frequent cleanings."
}
},{
"@type": "Question",
"name": "Is it possible to remove tough stains during an upholstery cleaning session?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Professional upholsterers use specialized techniques and solutions that can effectively treat and remove tough stains from furniture. While not all stains can be completely removed—especially if theyve been left untreated for a long time—experienced technicians stand a good chance at significantly reducing or eliminating difficult spots."
